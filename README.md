3: Run Button - this button automatically runs the simulation until you press it again.

4: Status Text - this tells you what the simulation is doing.

5: Day Counter - this shows you how many days have passed since the start of the simulation.

6: Peak Population Counter - this displays the highest ever number of [Individuals](###individuals) alive during this simulation.

7: Number of Individuals Alive Counter - this simply displays the current amount of Individuals that are alive.
